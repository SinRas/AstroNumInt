# Astronomical Numerical Integration

This is a __public__ git project under no license, yet!
This is a code to calculate numerical integral using monte carlo integraion.

The main difficulty here is the **precision**.

Let it rain! :blush:

(I'll be back whenever the project has advanced and code is updated! :wink:)
